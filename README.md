**Summary**:


Bike-sharing systems, while alleviating urban "last mile" challenges, face rebalancing issues due to uneven spatial distribution of bicycles, necessitating truck-based redistribution for optimal supply. This study focuses on the critical first step—demand prediction—to forecast bike/dock availability using Philadelphia’s Indego system, operational since 2015 with expanded infrastructure. Leveraging a 5-week dataset (May 17–June 20, 2021), temporal and spatial analyses are conducted through predictive models (OLS, Random Forest, ARIMA, Neural Networks) to anticipate station-level demand, aiming to optimize rebalancing strategies by informing efficient truck routing and resource allocation for enhanced operational efficiency.
